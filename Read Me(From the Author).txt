'I took most of this codes from PSC so credit to whomever wrote them
'The purpose of this aplication is to explain how you can custumize controls
'with their own code inside an OCX and the call them from a Dll into your 
'application
'See if you can find a use for it, I already got mine...
'HINT: To be able to "Configure" personalized applications from a mother 
'application, so you
'don't have to code things all over again every tyme you want to write 
'a new program...
'if I didn't Explain myself, I believe you can figure it out....
The is a couple of things I feel I need to make clear about how to make this
project work....

First: Open each project individually, didn't test the working of it as 
a group so I don't know if it will work....
Second: Compile the OCX proyect
Third: Compile the DLL proyect
NOTE: You will not need to add the OCX control to the components list in
the Exe Proyect...somehow it works that way...
Fouth: Add the Dll Library to the reference list in the Exe Proyect
Fith: Execute the proyect and check out, if, and how it works...

This is not much of a code, but I will try to post the Follow Ups to my 
Proyect, but, why not...if you like it please vote :)
